## Overview

Since 2019, I've worked on residential construction and renovation projects through my family business, gaining practical experience in electrical installation, flooring, and full bathroom remodeling.

- Coordinated with electrical inspector
- Ensured all work met current NEC code

**Challenges Solved:**
- Working around existing structure
- Load calculations for proper circuit distribution
- Maintaining power to occupied areas during work
- Passing inspection on first try

**Timeline**: 6 weeks

### Bathroom Renovation Series (2022-2023)
Completed 5 full bathroom remodels

**Project 1: Master Bathroom**
- Removed existing tub, installed tile shower
- Custom tile work with accent stripe
- Installed dual-sink vanity with new plumbing
- Recessed lighting installation
- Exhaust fan with humidity sensor

**Project 2: Guest Bathroom**
- Tub refinishing and surround replacement
- New toilet and vanity installation
- Tile floor replacement
- Updated lighting and electrical

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Project planning and material estimation
- Coordinating multiple trades (plumbing, electrical, tile)
- Quality tile work with proper spacing and grout
- Problem-solving when issues arise

### Hardwood Flooring Projects (2021-2022)

**Residential Installation**: 3,000+ sq ft total

**Project Highlights:**
- Living room and dining room: 800 sq ft of red oak
- Bedrooms: 1,200 sq ft of engineered hardwood
- Hallways: Complex layout with multiple transitions

**Refinishing Projects:**
- Restored 100-year-old hardwood in historic home
- Sanding, staining, and polyurethane application
- Matched existing floor color in adjacent rooms

## Technical Knowledge

### Electrical Theory (Applied)
From hands-on work, I understand:
- Ohm's Law in practice (voltage drop calculations)
- AC power distribution in residential settings
- Circuit protection (breakers, fuses, GFCI, AFCI)
- Grounding and bonding for safety
- Load calculations and wire sizing
- Three-phase vs single-phase power

This practical knowledge directly complements my Electrical Engineering coursework in:
- Circuit analysis
- Power systems
- Electronics
- Control systems

### Building Systems Understanding
- How residential electrical systems are designed
- Load distribution and panel layout
- Integration of multiple systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
- Building codes and inspector requirements
- Real-world constraints vs. theoretical design

## Safety & Quality Standards

### Safety Practices
- OSHA training and compliance
- Proper PPE usage (safety glasses, gloves, dust masks)
- Lockout/tagout procedures for electrical work
- Fall protection when working at heights
- Tool safety and maintenance
- First aid and emergency procedures

### Quality Control
- Triple-check measurements before cutting
- Test all electrical circuits before covering
- Verify level and plumb on all installations
- Inspect own work critically
- Fix issues immediately, don't cover mistakes
- Professional appearance of final product

## Skills Transferable to Engineering

### Problem-Solving
Construction rarely goes exactly as planned. I've developed strong problem-solving skills:
- **Example 1**: Discovered unexpected plumbing in wall during electrical rough-in → rerouted wiring while maintaining code compliance
- **Example 2**: Floor not level for hardwood installation → installed tapered shims and additional subfloor
- **Example 3**: Circuit breaker tripping after new installation → identified and resolved ground fault

### Project Management
- Planning material needs and ordering
- Creating realistic timelines
- Coordinating with other trades
- Managing client expectations
- Budget tracking and cost control
- Adapting plans when issues arise

### Attention to Detail
- Precision measurements (work to 1/16" or better)
- Ensuring code compliance in all work
- Quality finishing work
- Thorough testing and verification
- Professional appearance of completed work

### Practical vs. Theoretical
Understanding the difference between:
- Ideal circuits vs. real-world electrical systems
- Perfect conditions vs. actual job sites
- Theory vs. practical constraints
- Design intent vs. construction reality
