    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/about.jpg"
    content: |-
      I'm a Computer & Electrical Engineering dual major at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with a passion for hardware design and digital systems. My experience spans from designing custom multicycle processors to hands-on residential construction and renovation work.

      When I'm not coding or building circuits, you'll find me snowboarding, at the gym, or spending time with my Australian Shepherd, Luna. I'm native in Spanish and fluent in English, and I bring the same problem-solving mindset from engineering to every project I tackle.

      **Current Focus:** Seeking summer 2025 internships in computer/electrical engineering where I can apply my processor design experience and contribute to real-world hardware/software systems.

Features include arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV), logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT), and control flow (JUMP, conditional branches). Successfully executed 2×2 matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion entirely in software using integer arithmetic. Deployed on Altera DE2-115 FPGA with 512-byte unified memory and real-time 7-segment display output. Implemented manual programming mode using FPGA switches for direct memory manipulation and testing. Achieved stable operation with comprehensive debugging features including pause-on-write and display of PC, opcode, and accumulator contents."
