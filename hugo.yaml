    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/about.jpg"
    content: |-
      I'm a Computer & Electrical Engineering dual major at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with a passion for hardware design and digital systems. My experience spans from designing custom multicycle processors to hands-on residential construction and renovation work.

      When I'm not coding or building circuits, you'll find me snowboarding, at the gym, or spending time with my Australian Shepherd, Luna. I'm native in Spanish and fluent in English, and I bring the same problem-solving mindset from engineering to every project I tackle.

      **Current Focus:** Seeking summer 2025 internships in computer/electrical engineering where I can apply my processor design experience and contribute to real-world hardware/software systems.
